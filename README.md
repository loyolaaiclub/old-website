### Develop

Should you be developing or extending the site, here is how to get started.

#### Required Software

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the
[PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).

To initalize the theme, run

```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

#### Optional Software

To format markdown files, we use
[`mdformat`](https://pypi.org/project/mdformat/). `mdformat` relies on
[Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install `mdformat` for this project, run:

`python3 -m pip install -r requirments.txt`
